# React Redux API Generator :lemon:

> Elegant and easy way to generate REST API actions for your project from `openapi-3.0 .yaml` file. Easily edit and generate quickly when required.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MarkusBansky/react-redux-generator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MarkusBansky/react-redux-generator) ![](https://github.com/MarkusBansky/react-redux-generator/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg) [![Percentage of issues still open](http://isitmaintained.com/badge/open/MarkusBansky/react-redux-generator.svg)](http://isitmaintained.com/project/MarkusBansky/react-redux-generator)

Currently supports api specification only in [**OpenAPI 3.0**](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md).

### Installation

To install this package we advise you to use `-g` to be able to use it globally.

```bash
$ npm install -g react-redux-api-generator
```

After you have installed this package, you have to be sure to install these packages as well to be able to use the code generated by this package:

* `axios` - used to create http requests
* `lodash` - extends library for objects manipulations
* `redux-axios-middleware` - creates react middleware for axios clients to be able to handle http requests through reducers

After you ensured that you have installed all required packages, you can use this package to generate the API from **OpenAPI** specification:

```bash
$ generate-axios-api
```

The package would search for `rrg-config.json` in current directory. If there is no such file it would try to use default settings.

### Configure

Create a file called `rrg-config.json` in your project's root directory next to your `package.json`.

To find out what configurations are possible visit the [Config Wiki](https://github.com/MarkusBansky/react-redux-generator/wiki/Configuration-file) page.

### Script

You can also create a build script in the package file:

```javascript
{
    "scripts": {
        ...
        "build-with-api": "npm run generate-axios-api && npm run build"
        ...
    }
}
```

And now you can just run it from a command line and this would perform full project build with api generation:

```bash
$ npm run build-with-api
```
